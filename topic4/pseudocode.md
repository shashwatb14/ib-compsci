# Pseudocode

- Method that can be used to represent programming concepts
- Used to plan algorithms
- Cannot be executed
- Must use IB's made-up pseudocode language
- Heavily based on Java
- Syntax and keywords must be memorized

## Convetions

- Comments must be preceded by double forward slashes `//`
- Variable names must be capitalized whereas syntax is lowercase (`mod`, `div`, `and`, `or`)
- Loops and conditional statements must have closing statements, i.e. `end loop` and `end if` respectively
- Multiple conditions can be achieved through lowercase `and` or `or`
