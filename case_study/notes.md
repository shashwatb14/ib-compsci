## Scenario
- **BotPro**:
    - Company that makes robots for various industrial applications
    - Focus shifted to making **rescue robots**
- **Rescue robots**:
    - Designed to help with the search and rescue of humans after a **disaster** (like earthquakes and tsunamis)
    - Assist the efforts of rescue teams by **searching** and **mapping** areas, assessing damage, removing debris, delivering supplies, and evacuating casualties
- Found to perform below expectations when sent into a large factory after a fire and another factory that was damaged by an earthquake
- Robot had trouble **navigating the factories** and **reaching the exact location of survivors**
- However, operation was successful when deployed in a stadium after strucutural damage
- Root cause was the accuracy and difference  of the `global positioning system (GPS) signal` inside the factories
    - Strength of the satellite signal received was **insufficient**, resulting in errors in calculating rescue robot's exact location
    - Factories were also an **unknown environement** to the robot
    - Damage caused meant that the **layout of the factories was different to any floor plans that existed**
